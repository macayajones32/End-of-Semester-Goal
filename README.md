# End-of-Semester-Goal
## My Semester Goals

In emerging coders this semester, I would like to learn how to create a Twitter bot. I would like to have this all finished by mid-April before semester finals. My first checkpoint will be in about two weeks, and I would like to have made sense of the code and have it working completely. For my next deadline, which will be around the end of March, I would like to have my bot able to listen to incoming requests. By the end of my project in April, I would like for my bot to be able to retweet my tweets and any tweet with a specific hashtag.
